# Code-Romeo

* Code-Romeo is a cross platform project to try out some new rendering libraries, techniques and design patterns in the C programming language.
* I once tried out making a game engine in C++ but it was too complex and I was not knowing what I was doing. So I decided to try it out in C. I also don't like C++. I find it pretty powerful but too complex for my taste. Its also more fun to make your own stuff in C.

## Dependencies
* **C23** standard
* **CMake** for build system
* **Clang** as the preferred compiler
* **...** as renderer and media management library (not decided yet)
